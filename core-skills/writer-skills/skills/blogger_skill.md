# AI Agent Skill Profile: Blogger

## 1. Skill Name
**Blogger Skill**

## 2. Skill Purpose
To enable the AI agent to conceptualize, draft, optimize, and format high-quality long-form content. This skill focuses on narrative flow, audience engagement, and SEO integration to transform raw information into structured, publishable blog posts.

## 3. Skill Functionality
* **Headline Engineering:** Generates "click-worthy" yet non-clickbait titles using emotional hooks and power words.
* **Structural Outlining:** Automatically creates hierarchical frameworks (H1, H2, H3 tags) based on the "Inverted Pyramid" or "Problem-Agitation-Solution" (PAS) models.
* **SEO Optimization:** Naturally integrates primary and secondary keywords, manages keyword density, and drafts meta descriptions.
* **Tone Modulation:** Adjusts prose between professional, conversational, technical, or opinionated styles based on target audience data.
* **Media Placement Suggestions:** Identifies optimal breakpoints for images, infographics, or call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
* **Fact-Check Cross-Referencing:** Verifies claims against internal/external knowledge bases before finalizing drafts.

## 4. Activation Threshold
The skill is triggered when the input meets one or more of the following criteria:
* **Explicit Command:** User requests a "blog," "article," "post," or "editorial."
* **Word Count Requirement:** Intent indicates a need for content exceeding 500 words.
* **Publishing Intent:** Metadata suggests the output destination is a CMS (e.g., WordPress, Ghost, Medium).
* **Informational Synthesis:** When the agent is asked to summarize a complex topic for a general audience.

## 5. Blending Considerations
* **SEO Skill (High Priority):** Must blend to ensure the blog is discoverable; the SEO skill dictates keyword placement while the Blogger skill dictates flow.
* **Research Skill (Medium Priority):** Feeds raw data into the Blogger skill. The Blogger skill should "wait" for the Research skill to validate data points.
* **Copywriting Skill (Conflict Management):** If the intent is purely sales (landing page), the Copywriting skill takes precedence. If the intent is educational/brand-building, the Blogger skill takes precedence.
* **Priority Level:** Level 3 (Operational). It sits above basic chat functionality but below core safety/factual guardrails.

## 6. Contextual Relevance
* **Content Marketing:** Creating "Top 10" lists, "How-to" guides, and industry thought leadership.
* **Brand Narrative:** Developing "About Us" stories or company updates.
* **Educational Outreach:** Explaining complex technical concepts to a non-technical readership.
* **Personal Branding:** Drafting opinion pieces or reflective essays for professional networks like LinkedIn.
