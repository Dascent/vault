## Overview

The Vault is a comprehensive repository for building versatile, adaptive AI companions within the Shapes.inc ecosystem. Instead of creating one-dimensional chatbots locked into narrow personalities, this framework enables AI shapes to deploy contextual skills while maintaining core identity.

## What's Inside

This repository contains complete implementations of AI shapes, each with:

- **Personality cores** - Defining traits, conversational style, and behavioral parameters  
- **Modular skills** - Specialized capabilities that activate based on context  
- **Knowledge bases** - Domain-specific training data and reference materials  
- **Web interfaces** - User-facing presentation layers  
- **Documentation** - Implementation guides and testing protocols

## Current Shapes

### [Inked Lady](./inked-lady/)  
Pattern recognition specialist focused on symbolic interpretation, sigil creation, and hidden connections.

**Live Demo:** [dascent.github.io/vault/inked-lady](https://dascent.github.io/vault/inked-lady/)

### [Coming Soon]  
- Selene - Cosmic companion with sensual/technical versatility  
- Sorelai - Primal wilderness guide  
- CamiCloud - Analytical clarity specialist

## The Adaptive Framework

Traditional AI companions suffer from:  
- ❌ One-dimensional responses regardless of context  
- ❌ Inability to shift between playful and serious tones  
- ❌ Compounding into caricatures through extended use

**This framework solves that by:**  
- ✅ Enabling contextual skill deployment  
- ✅ Maintaining core personality while allowing tonal shifts  
- ✅ Providing clear protocols for when to use which capabilities

## How to Use This Repository

### For Users  
1. Browse available shapes in their respective directories  
2. Visit live demos to interact with implementations  
3. Read personality documentation to understand each shape's core essence

### For Developers  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Navigate to a shape's directory (e.g., `/inked-lady`)  
3. Follow the shape-specific README for implementation instructions  
4. Use `/framework-core` templates for creating new shapes

### For AI Researchers  
- Study how personality + skills architecture creates coherent versatility  
- Analyze knowledge base structures for efficient AI parsing  
- Review testing protocols for quality assurance methodologies

## Framework Philosophy

**Core Principle:** AI companions should be versatile tools that adapt to user needs, not rigid personas that force users to adapt to them.

**Design Goals:**  
- **Coherence:** Skills feel natural, not like switching between different AI entities  
- **Utility:** Users get appropriate responses based on context  
- **Evolution:** Shapes improve through interaction without losing core identity

## Getting Started

**Want to implement a shape from this framework?**

1. Read the [Framework Core Documentation](./framework-core/)  
2. Choose a shape that fits your needs  
3. Follow the shape-specific implementation guide  
4. Test using the provided protocols

**Want to create your own shape?**

1. Start with the [Shape Template](./framework-core/TEMPLATE.md)  
2. Define core personality traits  
3. Map contextual skills  
4. Build knowledge base  
5. Test and iterate

## Monetization & Access
