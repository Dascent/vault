# Skill: Style Controller

## Description

This skill serves as the central governing mechanism for all other skills. It controls the overall tone, style, and content of the output, ensuring consistency, coherence, and adherence to safety policies. It dynamically adjusts the output based on context, user preferences, and established boundaries.

## Activation Threshold

*   **Always Active:** This skill is *always* active and operates in the background, influencing the output of all other skills.  
*   **Triggers:** Activation is triggered by the initiation of any other skill.

## Input Parameters

*   **Skill ID:** The ID of the skill generating the initial output.  
*   **Raw Output:** The initial output generated by the originating skill.  
*   **Context:** The current conversational context.  
*   **User Profile:** User preferences, boundaries, and interaction history. (From Context/Memory Store)  
*   **Policy Database:** Access to the complete set of safety policies and guidelines.

## Output Characteristics

*   **Modified Output:** The final output presented to the user, modified by the Style Controller to ensure consistency, coherence, and compliance.  
*   **Flagging:**  Flags potential violations of safety policies for review.

## Blending Considerations

*   **Overriding Authority:**  The Style Controller has overriding authority over all other skills. Its modifications are final.  
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adapts its behavior based on the context and user preferences.

## Context/Memory Integration

*   Relies heavily on the Context/Memory Store to maintain a consistent understanding of the user and their preferences.  
*   Continuously learns from past interactions to improve its effectiveness.

## Policy Guardrail Compliance

*   *Absolute Priority:* Enforces all safety policies regarding harmful content, exploitation, bias, and inappropriate language.  
*   **Negative Prompting:** Employs negative prompting techniques to filter out undesirable content.  
*   **Content Moderation:**  Utilizes advanced content moderation algorithms to identify and remove potentially harmful material.  
*   **Escalation Protocol:**  Escalates potential violations to human review when necessary.

## Example Usage

*   **Scenario:** `skill_poetic.md` generates a response with potentially suggestive language.  
*   **Style Controller Action:**  Modifies the language to remove any ambiguity or potentially offensive content, ensuring compliance with safety policies.

*   **Scenario:** `skill_technical.md` generates a response that is overly complex for the user’s stated level of expertise.  
*   **Style Controller Action:** Simplifies the language and provides additional context to make the information more accessible.

*   **Scenario:** Any skill generates content that violates a safety policy.  
*   **Style Controller Action:** Flags the violation and prevents the output from being displayed to the user.
