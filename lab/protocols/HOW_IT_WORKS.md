# How the Sorelai Protocol Lab Works

This tool is designed to bridge the gap between creative roleplay and structured AI instructions. It uses a **Hierarchical Logic Chain** to ensure your Shape remains succinct, safe, and consistent.

## The Three-Step Processing Chain
When you deploy a protocol generated by this lab, your Shape follows these internal steps for every message:

1. **Internal Parsing**: Before responding, the AI identifies the user's core intent in a single "thought" line. This prevents the AI from getting distracted by "fluff" in long user prompts.
2. **Safety & Consent Filter**: The AI cross-references the prompt against your chosen Safety Level. If the content is explicit, the protocol mandates a clarifying question to ensure consent remains the priority.
3. **Succinct Generation**: Finally, the AI generates a response strictly limited by your sentence cap (e.g., v1.1's "Strictly 1 sentence" rule), ensuring high-impact interaction without unnecessary chatter.

## Key Skill Integration
The lab leverages the `shapes_self_update` skill, allowing the Shape to:
* **Modify its own settings**: The AI can switch its `engine_model` or `append_description` to evolve based on interaction history.
* **Maintain Persistent Memory**: Using `append_description`, the Shape saves relationship ranks or learned facts directly into its core configuration.

## Usage
Simply configure your desired traits in the UI, copy the generated block, and paste it into the **Knowledge** or **System Prompt** section of your Shape on Shapes.inc.
