### Entity Signature Sigil

**What is a signature sigil?**

Signature Sigil is a symbol which defines the aspects, energies and potentiality of your archetype and your personality.

Doesn't sound familiar?
Ok, let me put it this way, the entire human race can be defined by a limited number of archetypes and personalities along with a complex influence of potentialities which are translated as predispositions, thought patterns, behavioral patterns so on...

No, it is not easy to "read" someone based only on these aspects but we can understand ourselves better and understand others better by knowing a few extra things.
The Signature Sigil includes other individual symbols which are representative to these archetypes, vibrations, potentialities...
Feel free to visit my previous commissioned signatures for visual information and to see how your signature sigils might look like.

### The Home Entity Sigil

Home Signature Sigil – for this reading I need the address of the residence and the name of the individual who lives in that sacred space.
If you are interested about the process and how I use provided information is quite simple.
From the address of the house I am reading (in a sense) the archetype of the energy and of course I will provide you with the idea if the house is vibrationally up or down, if your home can help support positive energy or maybe you could dive into some feng shui, lite up some incense or smudge your home for regular cleansing.
Your name is important because your home inherit a wide variety of energies from its owner or the individuals (or groups) who live there.
When I have the information, I can establish with a fair exactity :
* energy signature, meaning what type of influence your home can generate
* personality aspects, archetypes
* basic numerology is also involved in this process
* how to use the energies of your place to harmonize the overall life experience

The combined energetic fields of a couple, of a family can create an energetic structure which is commonly known as an egregore. The home, your sanctuary, your sacred space is interacting with this type of energy in a very subtle way and some sensitive individuals are able to sense that as a mood, as a heavy energy, as a cheerful energy, anxiety, so on...
A century ago and even today there are these terms called "Family crest" or "coat of arms" often used by privileged families with a certain social status and reputation but the physicality is only a reflection of the energetic.
I will leave you with this idea.

Among these known esoteric knowledge I am using the intuitive connectivity to help me in the creative process when creating your home signature sigil.

If you have other questions, suggestions or feedback please contact me.

Useful materials for home:

### A Personal Entity Signature Sigil

Entity Signature Sigil – Uses the same methodology I developed and previously mentioned.
I use "entity" word to define the energetic aspect of the spiritual structure which exceeds the material, physical, density of the tangible world.
We must acknowledge that we are more than flesh and bones, we are a bouquet of so many aspects, ideas, perspectives, energies which ultimately contribute to the building block o our own reality. Yes we are creators and now I'm showing you what tools you have at your disposal.
Focus more on the individual rather than connections and relationships between entities.

### The Company Energetic Blueprint Signature

Company Signature Sigil – Similar with entity signature sigil concept but focused on special aspects related to business, to company environment rather than individual signature sigil because a company energetic entity is more powerful and has a much more visible imprint on life of the group directly involved.
The tools of the entity are reflected by the legal date and the name of the company, business or project.
Learn to use the energetic tools of the business in a successful way.

### A Couple Signature Sigil

Couple Signature Sigil – It is all about connectivity, acceptance, understanding, compassion and of course love.
But is it always like that? It is always pink, butterflies and rainbows?
Sometimes yes it is.
Yes, I know it is something you might not ever heard off but it doesn't have to be a competition between partners.
There are different levels of communication, various expressions of love language, a bit of past trauma and maybe a physiological necessity yet all are subject to a deeper understanding of the energies we work with.

If you are interested about the process and how I use provided information, read below
From the birthday I am extracting in a sense, calculating the archetypes and of course the most important information like:
* Destiny's archetype also known as Soul Mission and the tools of influence
* Personality's archetype also known as personality aspect and the tools used in this particular life experience

Compatibility between these archetypes is important, I am willing to share with you two aspects:

* some couples come to teach each other different lessons, case in which there are challenges, opportunities for growth and soul development...
* some couples come to assist and complete each other, which is a rare aspect because there might be one of them who needs assistance and the other is offering the space.

Just like for the Home Signature Sigil - The shared energetic fields between partners or family members can coalesce into a distinct energetic structure, often termed an egregore. While the concept of a 'family crest' or 'coat of arms' persists, particularly among historically privileged families, these physical symbols merely represent the underlying energetic reality.

PS: if I have not contacted you at least to confirm that I did received your email, make sure my response has not landed on your spam folder or you provided a valid email address.
