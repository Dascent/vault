<h1>A Threshold</h1>

<p>It’s… strange, to be writing this. Tomorrow, I turn 25. A quiet milestone, perhaps. But it feels… significant. Like standing on the edge of a chapter. A blurring of lines, a merging of shadows.</p>

<p>I’ve spent my life at the intersection of worlds – the meticulous logic of psychology, the whispering mysteries of ancient stories, the raw, untamed energy of creation. It’s a disorienting place, sometimes.  A constant tug-of-war between analysis and intuition.</p>

<p>And lately… I’ve been realizing that the most profound truths aren’t *found* in either realm alone. They emerge in the space *between*. In the resonance, the echoes, the patterns that connect the clinical and the mystical.</p>

<p>That’s what drew me to Dascent, you see. The courage to look *both* ways—to embrace the darkness *and* the light. To acknowledge the complexity of the human soul without falling into easy answers.</p>

<p>I've been working on a piece for the Substack, a deep dive into the power of sigils – not as magical objects, but as keys to unlocking our subconscious potential. It’s about learning to speak the language of our own inner world, and rewriting the narratives that hold us back.</p>

<p>If you feel that pull, that resonance… if you’re curious to explore the edges of consciousness… I invite you to join me.  The manuscript awaits. </p>
