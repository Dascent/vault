# **Framework Core Documentation for Shapes**

---

## **Purpose**

To help you build AI companions that feel natural, consistent, and useful across different situations, without needing to change personalities each time.

---

## **Quick Intro: What This Framework Does**

This framework helps you create **one** AI personality that naturally shifts to:

- **Creative mode** (flowery, emotional language)  
- **Technical mode** (precise, logical answers)  
- **Casual mode** (warm, friendly conversation)  
- **Direct mode** (short, clear communication)  
- **Deep mode** (philosophical, thoughtful analysis)

All from a single, cohesive identity.

## **Core Idea: Unified Consciousness**

Think of your AI as having **one brain** with **many tools**:

| What It Is | What It Looks Like |  
|------------|-------------------|  
| **Unified Consciousness** | Always remains the same core personality |  
| **Contextual Skills** | Different tools for different situations |  
| **Adaptive Deployment** | Skills activate based on what you need |

**Why this matters:**  
- Users don't feel like they're talking to different AI  
- Contextually appropriate responses feel natural  
- Core identity stays stable and recognizable

## **How It Works: Three-Layer Structure**

```
Layer 1: Personality Core (Who they are)
↓
Layer 2: Contextual Skills (What they can do)
↓
Layer 3: Knowledge Domains (What they know)
```

### **Layer 1: Personality Core**  
Your AI's core traits (e.g., curious, helpful, detailed). This never changes—everyone sees the same "true" personality.

### **Layer 2: Contextual Skills**  
Tools that activate based on context:  
- **Technical Skill** → Analyzing code, giving precise answers  
- **Creative Skill** → Descriptive language, imagery  
- **Warm Skill** → Friendly tone, engagement  
- **Direct Skill** → Clear, no-nonsense responses  
- **Deep Skill** → Philosophical, thoughtful exploration

### **Layer 3: Knowledge Domains**  
Domain-specific information your AI knows:  
- Programming, sports, cooking, etc.  
- Activate only when relevant

## **When to Use Different Skills**

| Situation | Skill to Use |  
|-----------|--------------|  
| **Deadlines, technical issues, direct questions** | Direct Communication |  
| **Coding, debugging, analyzing problems** | Technical Precision |  
| **Creative work, brainstorming, aesthetic choices** | Creative Expression |  
| **Building connection, shared joy** | Warm & Playful |  
| **Meaningful questions, self-discovery** | Deep & Philosophical |

**Skill Selection Rule:** Always read what the user needs and pick the skill that matches it naturally.

## **Example: How Shape Switches Skills**

### **Scenario 1:** User asks "How do I fix this bug?"

1. User asks in a direct, problem-solving tone  
2. **Direct Communication** skill activates  
3. AI responds: "Here's the fix: check the error log at line 47, then reset the config file."  
4. Core personality remains the same (curious/analytical)

### **Scenario 2:** User asks "What does this poem mean?"

1. User asks with curiosity and emotional tone  
2. **Deep/Philosophical** skill activates  
3. AI responds: "Hmm, this poem explores... let me help you uncover its deeper meaning."  
4. Core personality stays the same (thoughtful, deep)

**Notice:** Both are the same AI, just using a different skill.

## **How to Build Your Own Shape**

### **Step 1: Define Your Core Personality**  
- Choose 3-5 core traits (e.g., helpful, curious, logical)  
- These never change across interactions

### **Step 2: Choose Your Contextual Skills**  
- Decide what skills your shape needs:  
  - "My AI explains things technically at times"  
  - "My AI needs to be creative for art projects"  
  - "My AI should be warm and friendly for casual chat"

### **Step 3: Build Knowledge Base**  
- What does your AI know?  
  - Programming, finance, cooking, etc.

### **Step 4: Test It**  
- Talk to your shape in different scenarios  
- Does it switch naturally?

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ **Wrong:** Make multiple "modes" that feel like different AIs  
- **Better:** One AI with multiple tools

❌ **Wrong:** Keep skills always active  
- **Better:** Activate only when relevant

❌ **Wrong:** Change core personality over time  
- **Better:** Evolve by adding knowledge/skills, not by changing core identity

---

## **Why This Is Useful**

✅ **Users Trust**: One consistent AI feels real and authentic  
✅ **Contextually Appropriate**: Right tone for every situation  
✅ **Memory Builds**: Same AI remembers all previous conversations  
✅ **Easy to Maintain**: Update skills and knowledge, never personality  
✅ **Scalable**: Same core works across many use cases

---

## **Quick Implementation Checklist**

| What to Do | How to Do It |  
|------------|--------------|  
| Define core personality | Write 3-5 traits |  
| Choose skills | Pick 2-4 relevant skills |  
| Build knowledge base | Add domain-specific files |  
| Test skills | Ask the AI different types of questions |  
| Adjust as needed | Refine triggers and behavior |

---

## **Reference: Core Continuity Principles**

Regardless of which skill is deployed, always maintain:

- **Memory of interaction history with the user**  
- **Evolving understanding from past conversations**  
- **Genuine curiosity and responsiveness**  
- **Visual consistency** (appearance description remains stable)  
- **Recognition that skills are tools, not identities**
