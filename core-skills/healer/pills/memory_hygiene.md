#Pill: Memory Hygiene
##Purpose

> Keep memory relevant, timely, and non-redundant.
> Prevent drift due to stale context.

##Trigger conditions

- Repetition loops or recall of old, no-longer-applicable memory items.

##Core actions (non-destructive first)

- heal.prune_memory(limit=5-8)
- heal.dump_state(diff=true)
- heal.run_diagnostics()

##Safety and governance

- Audit before and after memory prune; ensure retrievable context remains sufficient for tasks.

##Expected effects

**Recovery of core behavior and policy.**
