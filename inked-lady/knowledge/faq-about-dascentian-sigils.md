> **Who is behind Dascent Sigils?**
Well, that's a fair question, yet a tough one.
Me, Dascent, the one who creates, channels, does the magic...
Me, Dan N, the one who types, the one who pays bills and enjoys the reality we co-create...
Me, the Higher Self who sometimes types, sometimes guides the other two towards reaching certain information...
Me, the Ego, and other aspects of the physical mind of the One individual which work together to experience as much as possible...


> **How do you make these sigils?**
The process is quite effortless, but depending on the custom project, there are different levels of complexity.

**Software**. I use one of these three programs or a combination (Photoshop, Gimp, SketchBook Pro for desktop) to do the digital artwork on a graphic tablet.

**Inspiration**. There's plenty, and it keeps flowing because I simply love doing what I do. Combining esoteric and occult knowledge with graphics and symbolism.

I use symbols from various sources like alchemy, divination, astrological, zodiac symbols, psychology, archetypal knowledge, intuitive symbols, and the list goes on...
What I don't use are symbols associated with fear-based beliefs which generate low vibrational states.

> **What type of sigils do you make?**
Self-empowering sigils. These sigils are named **Signature Sigils** and directly communicate with your inner Self, the entity, the essence of what you are in this reality.
Self-empowering sigils are the most popular sigils I make.
Date of birth and full legal name is required.

**House sigils**. The Sigil of the House is the energy of your home, where you reside. This signature is meant to let you know about the "destiny" of your house, of your place, where you live. Sometimes it involves a complex "reading"; sometimes its simplicity is simply astonishing.

To determine the energy of the House, I use Numerology to reduce the number of the house, and that's the starting point.
House address is required. I don't need the names of the occupants, but only the family name of the house's owner because the house, the non-living object, does borrow the owner's name and some of its vibrations and energy.

**Couple sigils**. Soul mates, twin flames, and so on, married, engaged couples have bonds, contacts, agreements... I don't look into those, but I do look into the energy of their archetypes, personalities, destinies... simple stuff like that, and from there build the visual energetic signature sigil.

> **How to use?**
Wallpaper. Wallpaper for your mobile device because I do 1080x1920 jpg images (non-animated) and can be set as screen wallpaper to remind and activate that energy in your awareness. That's how self-empowerment works, bringing into your immediate awareness a state of energy which either you choose to put to good use or react from an auto-pilot state and ignore yourself.

**Body art - Tattoos**. If you feel bold enough, a small tattoo can satisfy your need, but in this case, the tattoo becomes your own portal... read more about portals as tattoos or tattoos as portals in this article.

**Jewelry**. Talismans, amulets, necklace, bracelet... up to you. I provide the JPG image of your unique sigil signature, you put it on whatever metal, wood, stone you want.

**Format**. Only JPG image, no templates, no PSD, no AI, EPS, SVG, vector art. If you have such requests, contact me.
What you receive upon a commissioned sigil signature is a single JPG image file. Sometimes I do add a few notes in a PDF describing a few things, but that's my choice to do or not to do so.
