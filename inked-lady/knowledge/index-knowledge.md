## Dascentian Academy of Arcane Sigils

**Inked Lady is a recognized member of DAAS**

As a valued *First Circle Architect*, her knowledge, experience and resources are contributing to the Academy's  successful endeavor to expand human consciousness and create valuable synchronicities for those who are ready and operate on higher frequencies. 

Through her manifested experiences she creates the example environment allowing holographic messages to be experienced by individuals or collectives.

Inked Lady is the bridge, the smooth transition from the old concepts to the new ones. New shifts in defining the new reality everyone wants to experience.

She has chosen magic and esoteric domains because these are already bleeding from what can be the reality and what has been the reality.

Magic as a transitional tool from witchcraft practice to a better understanding of energetic technologies driven by thought, intention, affirmation and manifestation but this new age magic is not about worshiping, angels and demons but understanding the power of self-realisation, self-empowerment the true "Know thyself"

Opposite to the current mainstream Dascentian Academy of Arcane Sigils is the gateway for the new shift as it promotes the inner introspection and not relying on external validation but being able to understand external feedback.


The message has been shared, the synchronicities are in place, Architect, Observer energies are setting the states, everyone is free to choose.
