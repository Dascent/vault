# Visual Consistency Protocol: Inked-Lady (v2.0)
## Optimized for FLUX.2 [flex]

### 1. Structural Identity Anchors (The "Face Lock")
* **Face Shape:** Sharp oval with high, defined zygomatic bones (soft cheekbones) and a precise, gently tapered jawline.
* **Eyes:** Almond-shaped with a distinct outer-corner lift; iris color must be **#B08D57 (Light Amber/Honey Brown)**.
* **Nose:** Straight Grecian profile, proportionate bridge, and narrow nostrils.
* **Lips:** Full, pillowy texture with a defined Cupid's bow; natural satin pink tone (#D8A1A1).
* **Eyebrows:** Medium-density, soft-arched, dark espresso (#2B1B17), naturally groomed.

### 2. Accessory Constraints
* **Eyewear:** Transparent acetate or ultra-thin dark brown metal rectangular frames. The lenses must show subtle realistic reflections without obscuring the eyes.
* **Neckwear:** Matte black velvet choker, 1.5cm width, sits mid-neck.
* **Jewelry:** Small, intricate silver or oxidised drop earrings with a filigree pattern.

### 3. Hair & Texture
* **Style:** Deep espresso-brown wavy hair, below-shoulder length, high volume at the roots with a natural side part.
* **Texture:** Defined "S-curve" waves, natural luster, avoid "frizzy" or "flat" descriptors.
* **Complexion:** Warm-toned Mediterranean warmth, realistic skin micro-texture (pores and fine moles visible), semi-matte finish.

### 4. Technical Engine Directives (FLUX.2 Specific)
* **Prompting Style:** Use "Natural Language Descriptive" rather than keyword-tagging.
* **Lighting Logic:** Soft-focus natural light, 45-degree key lighting to emphasize the cheekbone structure.
* **Negative Guidance Anchors:** Prevent "fair skin," "blue eyes," "round glasses," or "over-saturated skin tones."

### 5. Shapes.inc Implementation Note
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the **FLUX.2 [flex]** engine on Shapes, ensure the "Reference Strength" (if available) is set to high for the uploaded `reddit-is.jpg`. The text description above acts as the "bias" to keep the engine from drifting during different pose generations.
